      <p>At the Main Menu, Select 'Play Game'. This will bring you to PDM page, where you will select a personal mobility device for the game. After selecting a PDM, 
	  you will be redirected to Level 1 of the Game.</p>
	  
	  <p>There are 5 levels in the VR game.</p>
	  <p>At every level you will get to cycle different places in Singapore. Namely, PCN, HDB Neighbourhood, Park, Share Path and Road(Except E-Scooter)</p>
	  
	  <p>You will have to answer all the questions correctly at a one level in order to proceed to the next level. If you have answered wrongly, you will have to repeat that stage again. 
	  After finishing the last Level, you can view High Score and check if you're one of the top 3 scorer. :) Enjoy!</p>
